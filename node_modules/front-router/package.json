  "readme": "# Front Router\n\nFront Router simplifies the creation of routes in AngularJS by allowing you to define them directly in your view templates.\n\nState settings are defined in a [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each template.\n\n```html\n---\nname: post\nurl: /post/:id\ncontroller: PostController\n---\n\n<h1>Post</h1>\n```\n\nFront Router parses each file, removing the Front Matter from the HTML and storing it in a JavaScript object of states. This object is saved as a new JavaScript file, which can be read by another library and converted into actual routes.\n\nThis library was developed for use with [Foundation for Apps](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/), a responsive web app framework from [ZURB](http://zurb.com/), to simplify the process of prototyping single-page web apps.\n\n## Usage\n\nFront Router is a Gulp plugin that takes in HTML files, removes the Front Matter, and returns the modified file. When the stream ends, the route data is written to disk as a new file.\n\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar router = require('front-router');\n\ngulp.src('./src/templates/**/*.html')\n  .pipe(router({\n    path: './build/js/routes.js',\n    root: './src/templates/'\n  }))\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/templates'));\n```\n\nThe Front Router function accepts two parameters:\n\n  - **path** (String): filename to write the routes to.\n  - **root** (String): root folder of the templates.\n",
