  "readme": "# Foundation for Apps\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zurb/foundation-apps.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zurb/foundation-apps)\n\nThis is [Foundation for Apps](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps), an Angular-powered framework for building powerful responsive web apps, from your friends at [ZURB](http://zurb.com).\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou'll need the following software installed to get started.\n\n  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.\n  * [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads): Use the installer for your OS.\n    * Windows users can also try [Git for Windows](http://git-for-windows.github.io/).\n  * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/): Use the installer for your OS. For Windows users, [JRuby](http://jruby.org/) is a popular alternative.\n    * With Ruby installed, run `gem install bundler sass`.\n  * [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `[sudo] npm install -g gulp bower`\n\n## Get Started\n\nThe Sass and JavaScript components are available on Bower and npm.\n```\nbower install foundation-apps --save\nnpm install foundation-apps --save\n```\n\nYou can also use our command-line interface to quickly setup a basic Foundation for Apps project. It includes a pre-built Gulpfile that compiles an Angular-powered web app for you.\n\nInstall it with this command:\n```\nnpm install -g foundation-cli bower gulp\n```\n\nNow you can make a new project:\n```\nfoundation-apps new myApp\ncd myApp\n```\n\nWhile working on your project, run:\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will assemble the templates, static assets, Sass, and JavaScript. You can view the test server at this URL:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8080\n```\n\n## Building this Repo\n\nIf you want to work with the source code directly or compile our documentation, follow these steps:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps.git\ncd foundation-apps\nnpm install\n```\n\nWhile you're working on the code, run:\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThe documentation can be viewed at the same URL as above.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n* `build`: This is where our documentation is assembled. **Don't edit these files directly, as they're overwritten every time you make a change!**\n* `docs`: The Foundation for Apps documentation.\n* `scss`: The Sass components.\n* `js`: The Angular modules and directives, and other external libraries.\n* `iconic`: A set of 24 icons from the folks at [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/).\n* `dist`: Compiled CSS and JavaScript files, in minified and unmified flavors.\n* `tests`: Unit tests for the Angular modules.\n\n## Versioning\n\nFoundation for Apps follows semver, so we won't introduce breaking changes in minor or patch versions. The `master` branch will always have the newest changes, so it's not necessarily production ready. The `stable` branch will always have the most recent stable version of the framework.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe love feedback! Help us find bugs and suggest improvements or new features. Follow us on Twitter at [@ZURBFoundation](https://twitter.com/zurbfoundation) to keep up-to-date with what's new, or to just shoot the breeze.\n\nIf you find a problem or have an idea, open a [new issue](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues) on GitHub. When filing a bug report, make sure you specify the browser and operating system you're on, and toss us a screenshot or show us how we can recreate the issue.\n",
